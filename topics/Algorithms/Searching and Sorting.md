## Searching Algorithms

### 1. Linear Search
A simple method that checks each element in a list sequentially until the target is found or the list ends.

### 2. Binary Search
An efficient algorithm for sorted arrays, repeatedly dividing the search interval in half to locate the target value.

### 3. Interpolation Search
An improved variant of binary search for uniformly distributed data, estimating the position of the target.

## Sorting Algorithms

### 1. Bubble Sort
A basic sorting technique that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### 2. Selection Sort
Sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and moving it to the beginning. This sorting algorithm takes minimum number of swaps in order to get the sorted array.

### 3. Insertion Sort
Builds the sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly inserting the next element into the correct position.

### 4. Merge Sort
A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts them, and merges the sorted halves.

### 5. Quick Sort
Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the array around a pivot and recursively sorts the partitions.

### 6. Counting sort

### 7. Heap Sort
Uses a binary heap data structure to efficiently sort elements by repeatedly extracting the maximum or minimum.
