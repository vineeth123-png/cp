# Adhoc Algorithms in Coding Interviews

Adhoc problems are those that do not fit into standard algorithmic categories and often require creative, out-of-the-box thinking. These questions test your problem-solving skills and ability to devise unique solutions.

## Introduction
Adhoc problems can involve a mix of logic, mathematics, and programming. They are common in coding interviews and competitive programming, often requiring you to spot patterns or use clever tricks.

## Common Examples

### 1. Kadane's Algorithm (Maximum Subarray Sum)
Kadane's Algorithm efficiently finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in O(n) time.

### 2. Digit Manipulation
Problems involving reversing digits, checking palindromes, or manipulating numbers without using extra space.

### 3. Pattern Construction
Questions that require constructing or counting patterns, such as generating specific sequences or grids.
