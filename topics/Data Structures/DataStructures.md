# Data Structures

## Skeleton

For each DS, we would include a brief intro (not required for each DS), and we'd include articles about each DS in their respective and info about its implementation in different languages like C++, Java and Python.

## Stack

LIFO principle's brand ambassador

Stack's usability - it stacks things up, and is useful for scenarios like recursion.
This property of having to peek the top element and pop it off based on a scenario, and continue this until its empty is seen in problems in next greater element.

This property might be the prinicple for monotonic stack, this def/statement would be updated later.
